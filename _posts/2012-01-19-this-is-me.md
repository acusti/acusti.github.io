I am a website programmer and developer. I build pretty great websites for the Montréal-based web shop [Pure Cobalt](http//www.purecobalt.com). If you wish to know more about my work, you can check out some of my projects (plugins and the like) at [my github profile](http://github.com/acusti "Mostly WordPress plugins, as of today"), or see [my website](http://www.acusti.ca "Includes a list of many of the websites I have built").

Perhaps the music shows promise, but it’s mostly pretty rough. Or honest, if you’d like.") [them](http://www.youtube.com/user/waveweaverjr "Youtube. I’m most proud of “freedom reruns”"). Also, I make [wine](https://twitter.com/wyattjaster/status/152977050486050816 "The strawberry wine was tasty"), and I drink with abandon.
