<address class="vcard">

I am <span class="fn">Andrew Patton</span>, a <span class="title">website programmer and developer</span>. I build pretty great websites for the Montréal-based web shop <a class="org url" href="http://www.purecobalt.com">Pure Cobalt</a>. If you wish to know more about my work, you can check out some of my projects (plugins and the like) at my <a href="http://github.com/acusti" title="WordPress plugins, mini sites, node.js-related forks, etc.">github profile</a>, or check out some of my <a class="url" href="{{ site.base_url }}/work" title="Includes a list of the most recent websites I have built">work</a>. Also, I try to contribute occasionally to [stack overflow][].

I have many passions, but considering that this site is ostensibly all about the code, let me start with my coding passions: client-side web development with JavaScript, CSS, and HTML and server-side web development with Node, Ruby on Rails, and PHP. I am also quite interested in, though entirely inexperienced with, iOS development. More specifically, I have a dream of a fantastic iPad app for musicians. Regardless of the language or project, I relentlessly pursue perfection, and find myself compelled to iterate meticulously over everything I build. Lastly, I am lately most interested in building highly usable and efficient user interfaces, both for website managers and users.

In my free time, I like to mess with music and video projects, and when feeling ambitious, [share][soundcloud] [them][youtube]. Also, I make wine, and I drink with abandon.

It may also be appropriate to mention that there is some useful information about me available, not surprisingly, at my [about.me profile][aboutme].
