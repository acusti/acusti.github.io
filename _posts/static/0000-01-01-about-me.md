<p class="vcard">Hi! I’m <span class="fn">Andrew Patton</span>, founding <span class="title">CTO</span> at <a class="org url" href="https://www.tributary.app">Tributary</a>. Previously, I architected and led the front-end engineering effort for <a href="https://timesites.com">TIME Sites</a>, a professional web design and publishing platform. To see what that looked like, check out our product designer’s <a href="https://jeremy-willer.getbrandcast.com">showcase</a> of the platform.</p>

If you wish to know more about my work, you can check out some of my projects [on this website][work] or see my open source work on my [github profile][]. Also, I contribute occasionally to [stack overflow][].

I have many passions, but considering that this site is all about web stuff, let me start with my current favorite web stack: Remix (using React) and TypeScript deployed to the edge on the Clouflare Workers platform. I also enjoy building iOS apps. Regardless of the language or project, I relentlessly pursue perfection, and find myself compelled to iterate meticulously over everything I build.

In my free time, I like to mess with music and video projects, and when feeling ambitious, [share][soundcloud] [them][youtube]. Also, I love fermentation and the wonderful things it produces.
