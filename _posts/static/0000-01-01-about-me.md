<p class="vcard">I am <span class="fn">Andrew Patton</span>, <span class="title">lead front-end engineer></span> at <a class="org url" href="http://www.purecobalt.com">Brandcast</a>. I have lead the front-end effort of putting together a powerful new desktop-class web application for creating, designing, and managing websites based on a fully modern stack (React, Redux, Immutable.js, Flow-type).</p>

If you wish to know more about my work, you can check out some of my projects (plugins and the like) at my [github profile][] or [on this website][work]. Also, I try to contribute occasionally to [stack overflow][].

I have many passions, but considering that this site is all about developing, let me start with my coding passions: client-side web development with JavaScript, CSS, and HTML and server-side web development with Node or Python. I also enjoy building iOS apps. Regardless of the language or project, I relentlessly pursue perfection, and find myself compelled to iterate meticulously over everything I build.

In my free time, I like to mess with music and video projects, and when feeling ambitious, [share][soundcloud] [them][youtube]. Also, I love fermentation and the wonderful things it produces.

You can find more links and info about me at my [about.me profile][aboutme].
