Hi! My name is Andrew Patton, and this is my blog. I hope to use it as a rostrum from which I will voice my thoughts about web development, or more generally, about building and crafting excellent user experiences. This being the first post, let me briefly introduce myself by shamelessly borrowing from the text of my [about.me profile][aboutme]:

I am a website programmer and developer. I build pretty great websites for the Montréal-based web shop [Pure Cobalt][]. If you wish to know more about my work, you can check out some of my projects (plugins and the like) at [my github profile][github], or see [my website][].

In my free time, I like to mess with music and video projects, and when feeling ambitious, [share][share music] [them][share video]. Also, I make [wine][], and I drink with abandon.
