<h1>About me</h1>
<p>It may be appropriate here to mention that there is much useful information about me available, not surprisingly, at my <a href="http://about.me/andrewpatton" title="Most useful for its service links and excellent background image">about.me profile</a>. In brief:</p>
<p>I am a website programmer and developer. I build pretty great websites for the Montréal-based web shop <a href="http//www.purecobalt.com">Pure Cobalt</a>. If you wish to know more about my work, you can check out some of my projects (plugins and the like) at <a href="http://github.com/acusti" title="Mostly WordPress plugins, as of today">my github profile</a>, or see <a href="http://www.acusti.ca" title="Includes a list of many of the websites I have built">my website</a>. Also, I try to contribute occasionally to <a href-"http://stackoverflow.com/users/333625/andrew-p">stack overflow</a>. My coding passions include client-side web development with javascript, CSS, and HTML and server-side web development with PHP. I am also quite interested in iOS development; though I am entirely inexperienced with it, I do have a dream of a fantastic iPad app for musicians and composers. Regardless of the language or project, I pursue perfection to an unhealthy degree, and find myself compelled to iterate continuously and meticulously over everything I build.</p>
<p>In my free time, I like to mess with music and video projects, and when feeling ambitious, <a href="http://www.myspace.com/beesallover" title="Myspace.
