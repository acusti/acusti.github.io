Welcome! I’m Andrew Patton, and this site is mostly about web dev&shy;elop&shy;ment and design, covering topics from tooling to user experience, from per&shy;formance to design, and from the specific to the general. I’ve worked as a web developer and front-end engineer since 2008 and am currently exploring how to use generative AI to build websites at <a href="https://outlyne.io">Outlyne.io</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
