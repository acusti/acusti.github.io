Current Employment

*[Pure Cobalt][] is a web agency based in Montréal, Québec, with a broad range of expertise and clientele.*

Selected Projects at Pure Cobalt
--------------------------------

**[Cinémathèque Québecoise][cq]** <span class="projects__time-period">Oct. 2013 – June 2014</span>  
Lead developer on a WordPress-powered online collections site and a powerful Solr-powered [search application][cqrecherche] for Québec’s official film archives. The search front end is a custom MVC application built with [FuelPHP][].

**[WP Theme Forme][forme]** <span class="projects__time-period">June 2013 – Ongoing</span>  
Created a WordPress starter theme framework with built-in support for tools like Compass/SASS, Susy, and icon fonts, plus sensible and scalable SASS/HTML scaffolding.

**[Web-Based Learning (WBL) course prototype][siemens]** <span class="projects__time-period">March – April 2014</span>  
Built a site prototype with RequireJS, [SMACSS/BEM principles][objects in space], and a feature-rich Grunt build process intended to make the platform easy to develop on and maintain. The work involved contributing to some [existing][svn-tag] [node][svn-project-root] [modules][svn-changelog], which introduced me to BDD-style unit testing via Mocha and Chai.

**[Jewish General Hospital search application][jgh]** <span class="projects__time-period">Dec. 2013 – March 2014</span>  
Built a fast and maintainable multilingual Solr-powered search front end, based on my initial design, for a hospital library using RequireJS and Handlebars.

**Salesforce dashboard for Bombardier** <span class="projects__time-period">Nov. 2013 – Feb. 2014</span>  
Optimized a widget-based dashboard for the Bombardier sales team for performance. Changes were two-fold: front end JavaScript optimizations based on JS profiling, and back end support for paginated results within widgets to reduce initial load time based on new unit tests.

**[Redux Media][redux]** <span class="projects__time-period">April – July 2013</span>  
A responsive advertising website for the Redux ad network built on WordPress. This was the first fully responsive website I built based on someone else’s design. During development, I created WP Theme Forme (above).

**[Adobe Edge Web Font Browser][edgebrowser]** <span class="projects__time-period">March – April 2013</span>  
Designed and built a responsive single-page application to help web designers and developers find and use fonts from the [Adobe Edge Web Fonts collection][edgefonts] (which were only browseable from within Adobe Edge apps).
