Current Employment
------------------

**Brandcast — Lead Front-End Architect** <span class="projects__time-period">July 2015 – Present</span><br>
*[Brandcast][] is a platform that powers the entire web publishing process from design to launch and beyond*

Selected Projects
-----------------

**[Brandcast Design Studio][]** <span class="projects__time-period">June 2016 – Present</span><br>
Build and architect experiences across the Brandcast platform, including the page editor, content editor, media library, and team member manager. Work with the rest of the front-end team to plan and code review maintainable solutions for new product needs. I work constantly to avoid and address code debt and keep the codebase flexible, scalable, and well-tested.

**[React.js Iframe Support][]** <span class="projects__time-period">Oct. 2016 – August 2018</span><br>
Modified the `react-dom` library to make it possible to render React components into a nested browsing context, i.e. an `iframe`, and worked with the core React.js team to land those changes in facebook/react.

**[Front-End UI NPM Modules][npm-acusti]** <span class="projects__time-period">March 2015 – Jan. 2016</span><br>
Built [onscrolling][] and [affixing-header][], two modules for constructing performant front-end UIs with solid UX. Both modules are tested, with Continuous Integration via Travis and, for Affixing Header, Selenium integration tests hooked up to SauceLabs for cross-browser testing.

**[Primal Multiplication][primal-multiplication]** <span class="projects__time-period">May – June 2015</span><br>
Built an experimental web app with ReactJS using ES 2015 features that generates a multiplication table of prime numbers. As documented in the [commit history][primal-multiplication-tdd], I used a TDD-based process throughout, writing tests to spec out new features, then implementing those features to make the tests pass.

**[Cinémathèque Québecoise][cq]** <span class="projects__time-period">Oct. 2013 – June 2014</span><br>
Lead developer and architect of a Solr-powered MVC search application built with [FuelPHP][] and a sibling WordPress-powered publication site for Québec’s official film archives.

**[Jewish General Hospital library search][jgh]** <span class="projects__time-period">Dec. 2013 – March 2014</span><br>
Built a fast and maintainable multilingual Solr-powered search front end, based on my initial design, for a hospital library using Handlebars and vanilla JS.
