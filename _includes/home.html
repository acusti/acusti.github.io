<p>Welcome! I am Andrew Patton, and while my passions are far ranging, this site is really about the tech. Most particularly, the code. My coding passions include client-side web development with javascript, CSS, and HTML and server-side web development with PHP. Regardless of the language or project, I pursue perfection to an unhealthy degree, and find myself compelled to iterate continuously and meticulously over everything I build.</p>
